            <h2>Ether 12:4</h2>
            <p>Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the
                right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make
                them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.</p>

            <h2>Moroni 10:3</h2>
            <p>Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should
                read them, that ye would remember how merficul the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the
                creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your
                hearts.</p>
